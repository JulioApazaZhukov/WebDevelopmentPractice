        <h1>Back End Web Development</h1>
        <p>Backend web development refers to the server-side aspect of web development, focusing on creating and
            managing the server logic, databases, and APIs. It involves handling user authentication, authorization, and
            processing user requests, typically using backend development languages such as Python, Java, Ruby, PHP,
            JavaScript (Node.js), and .NET.
            Backend developers are responsible for the behind-the-scenes work that it takes to build the structure and
            logic of a website. They create the invisible "brain" of websites run beneath the user-facing side.</p>

            <h2>Deno</h2>
            <p>Deno is a modern JavaScript runtime that serves as an alternative to Node.js, developed by Ryan Dahl, the
                creator of Node.js. It aims to address some of the limitations and security concerns of Node.js while
                providing a more secure and developer-friendly environment.
                Deno is built on the V8 JavaScript engine and the Rust programming language, and it supports JavaScript,
                TypeScript, and WebAssembly.</p>

            <h2>SQL</h2>
            <p>SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a domain-specific language used to manage and manipulate data in
                relational databases.
                It allows users to perform various operations such as querying, updating, and managing data.
                SQL is based on relational algebra and tuple relational calculus and includes different types of
                statements that can be informally classified as sublanguages, such as data query language (DQL), data
                definition language (DDL), data control language (DCL), and data manipulation language (DML).</p>

            <h2>NoSQL</h2>
            <p>NoSQL refers to a type of database design that stores and retrieves data differently from the traditional
                table-based structure of relational databases. Unlike relational databases, which organize data into
                rows and columns like a spreadsheet, NoSQL databases use a single data structure—such as key–value
                pairs, wide columns, graphs, or documents—to hold information. Since this non-relational design does not
                require a fixed schema, it scales easily to manage large, often unstructured datasets.
                NoSQL databases are sometimes called "Not only SQL" because they can support SQL-like query languages or
                work alongside SQL databases in polyglot-persistent setups, where multiple database types are combined.
